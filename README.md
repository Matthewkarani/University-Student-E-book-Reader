## Project Summary

This project is an e-reader application for university students to help
them develop better reading habits for their course materials. It has two users a lecturer and a student.
The lecturer creates courses they teach their students and shares the enrollment key with them. They then upload
course materials i.e. notes and summary videos that the students can access. When the student accesses the notes that the 
lecturer uploads they can add a reading schedule to them for the times that they want to read the notes. Reading will be done in
short intervals of 10 to 30 minutes at a time per reading session as per the student's preference. Students will receive notifications to read at the specified times.
Students can then view reports of the amount of time they spent reading over any given period. Lecturers can also view reading reports from the students enrolled in their various courses.

The application has been coded in Flutter to be run on Android, IOS, and web.

The project is still in progress.
