A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project is b5asically an e-reader application for university students whose purpose is to help
university students develop better reading habits of their course materials. It has two users a lecturer and a student
The lecturer creates courses that they are teaching their students and shares the key with their students.They then upload
course materials i.e notes and summary videos that the students can access. When then the students access the notes that the 
lecturer uploads they can add a reading schedule for the times that they want to read the notes. Reading will be done in
short intervals of 10 to 30minutes at a time. Students will receive notifications to read at their specified times.Students can then 
view reports of the amount of time they spent reading over any given period of time. Lecturers can also view reading reports of the
Students enrolled to their various courses.

Project is still in progress.
